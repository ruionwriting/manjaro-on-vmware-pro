# Ruby

## Install

For many years I've been using (RVM)() both in Linux and macOS but these days I've switched to rbenv, simpler and makes Ruby versions available sooner than RVM.

```shell
pamac install rbenv
```

```shell
pamac install ruby-build
```

eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"

curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash

https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv

rbenv install 3.1.0

rbenv global 3.1.0
